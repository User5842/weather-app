# Weather App

This application was inspired by the [Weather App](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Weather-App.md) found on [florinpop17](https://github.com/florinpop17)'s repository.

Watch the YouTube video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9TOfozkz4w).

The code differs slightly from that found on the video (some slight refactoring was done to make the code easier to work with, maintain, debug, etc.) but the general spirit remains.
