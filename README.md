# Weather App

This application was inspired by the [Weather App](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Weather-App.md) found on [florinpop17](https://github.com/florinpop17)'s repository.

The video counterpart will be uploaded the YouTube channel shortly. 

The code differs slightly from that found on the video (some slight refactoring was done to make the code easier to work with, maintain, debug, etc.) but the general spirit remains.
